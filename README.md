### Findings
Projects launched during the months of May and June had been the most successful.
1) 67% of the campaings launced during the month of May had been successful globally
2) 65% of the projects launched during the month of June have been successful Globally
Projects whos goals were between $35,000 to $39,999 have been sucessful in US
#### Recommendations
I would recommend to Louise to launch the program between the months of May and June. Also to reduce his goal to fir into the bracet of $35,000 - $39,000
##### Limitations of Data
The data is not divided my the cities, states or provinces, which would have helped us nerrow down to which geographical location the theater campaigns were most successful
